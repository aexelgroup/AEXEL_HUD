# AEXEL HUD (AEXELGROUP)

SwiftUI iOS app with:
- **HUD** overlay + mirror mode
- **Map** (Apple MapKit) with search, route drawing, step list
- **Simple voice guidance** (AVSpeech)
- **Settings** (units, mirror, voice, theme)
- **Loading screen** and tab navigation
- **Legal/About** screen with MIT license

> Note: MapKit provides routing and step instructions but not an out-of-the-box navigation UI; this starter renders a legible HUD from route progress.

## Build
Open `AEXELHUD.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15+, set Signing Team, run on device.
